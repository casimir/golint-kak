= A KISS linter for http://kakoune.org[Kakoune]

== Installation

Like many tools made in Go `golint-kak` is fairly easy to get.
----
go get github.com/casimir/golint-kak
----

Put a hook for go filetype in your _kakrc_.
----
hook window WinSetOption filetype=go %{
    set window lintercmd golint-kak
}
----

Alternatively you can use the awesome _syntastic_ script from
https://github.com/lenormf/kakoune-extra/blob/master/syntastic.asciidoc[lenormf/kakoune-extra].

== Concept

`golint-kak` wraps the official Go linters (like in "provided by Google") and
format the output to the linter format of
https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/rc/base/lint.kak[lint.kak].

Wrapped linters are the following.
https://github.com/golang/lint[golint]::
    This linter is intended to check coding style.
https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/cmd/vet[go vet]::
    This linter check code correctness.

*TODO* figure out how to handle licenses
